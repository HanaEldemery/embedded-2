# Embedded Factory Water Level Monitoring using C and RTOS on Arduino Nano RP2040 
I focused on integrating the necessary hardware components, developing structured software, and ensuring a fully functional embedded system. The first step was to purchase and connect at least three different sensors (including one analog sensor) and three actuators (one using PWM) to the Raspberry Pi Pico RP2040 microcontroller. Following the datasheets, I wired all the components to the microcontroller and secured them onto the project body, ensuring a neat and organized layout. Additionally, I implemented an initial structural design, aligning the hardware setup with the intended project functionality which was monitoring and regulating water levels and temperature efficiently to keep plants in a hospitable environment.
To validate the hardware functionality, I developed and tested drivers for each component, printing sensor values to a serial monitor for verification. A simple main control program was written to evaluate the performance of actuators under different conditions. Alongside hardware integration, I designed a state flow model illustrating the system’s behavior, incorporating design concepts such as concurrency, hierarchy, and broadcasting.
The next step was software development, where I wrote a comprehensive embedded C program that established seamless communication between all hardware components. To optimize the system’s efficiency, I integrated RTOS (Real-Time Operating System) to enable concurrency, ensuring parallel execution of tasks. To further assess the system’s robustness, I implemented a testing framework that simulated different input conditions, verifying the project's ability to handle various real-world scenarios.
For the final stage, I ensured that all hardware components were properly embedded in the design, eliminating excessive wiring and breadboards. The structural design was finalized, and an updated state flow diagram was created to reflect the latest modifications.
